<p>A simple way to make your site load much faster is to shrink
the size of any photos that need to be loaded. 
To do this, you could use a complex program like Photoshop,
or a simple command line tool like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">convert</code>. I recommend
using an even simpler approach of uploading files to a website
called <a href="https://tinyjpg.com/">tinyjpg</a> that will shrink them to a size that is optimal for displaying on the web.</p>

<p>If you wish to create additional webpages using Markdown 
separate from your README file â€“ for example to use as 
a blog, or for writing notes, or for sharing/hosting some
kind of information â€“ you can do so by simply adding 
a special header to any Markdown files that you create.
The file must have what is called 
<a href="https://assemble.io/docs/YAML-front-matter.html">YAML front matter</a>, 
which is used internally by jekyll to apply HTML templates 
to your Markdown file. This simply means you need to add 
a section with two lines containing three dashed lines at the top
of the file. In the case of a simple GitHub-pages setup, 
this will apply the â€˜defaultâ€™ style of your selected Theme.</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>

<span class="gu">### This is a post about ...</span>
I love to write in <span class="ge">*Markdown*</span>...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my example I created a new folder called <em>posts/</em> and added 
a file to it called <em>vacation.md</em>. Once I push these changes to 
GitHub my site will have new content viewable at 
<a href="https://hackers-test.github.io/posts/vacation.html">https://hackers-test.github.io/posts/vacation.html</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, to learn more about this topic you can dig into the 
Jekyll documentation.</p>
