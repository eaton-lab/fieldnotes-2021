## Day 8: Luhuo to Zamtang
There are many stops for this day, some are very short (get one specific
species), while a few others are long (drive up a long road). So try to 
move very fast on the short stops.


- Morphometrics for samples from previous collection sites:
	- Approximately N samples.

- Genomes (DNA, RNA, pollen, and 10 individuals)
	- P. armata

- RNA for comparative transcriptomes:
	- P. bidentata
	- P. ...

- Sites: 45, 46, 47, 124, 127, 118,

- 31.6113611, 100.7173611
- 3424m.
- Pine forest with shrubby understory. Rocky. Roadside.
- Make a very quick stop, semitorta is easy to find here. Get it for
morphology here and then you do not need to collect it again at later sites.

- [P. semitorta (DE195)](/assets/flowers/DE195-semitorta.jpg) (red): 
Morphology. Growing abundant on roadside.


<h3 class="mt-5"> Site 46 </h3>

- 31.6575, 100.7013055
- 3600m
- [Canyon](/assets/flowers/site-46.jpg) with rushing stream. Rocky, sandy soil in flood plain, pine forest on periphery.
- Many species here. The cranolopha is growing near the road, morphology
of this is important. Rhinanthoides is growing on the edge of the stream. Find
kansuensis growing common. Others are not necessary, do not spend too much time.

- [P. cranolopha (DE196)](/assets/flowers/DE196-cranolopha.jpg): Morphology always. <b>Important.</b> First 'tricolor-like'. 
- P. ingens (DE198): Morphology.
- P. kansuensis (DE199): Morphology always.
- P. semitorta (DE200): Morphology optional.
- P. densispica (DE201): Morphology optional.
- [P. decorissima (DE202)](/assets/flowers/DE202-decorissima.jpg): Morphology optional.
- [P. brevilabris (DE203)](/assets/flowers/DE203-brevilabris.jpg): Morphology optional.
- [P. cyathophylla (DE204)](/assets/flowers/DE204-cyathophylla.jpg): Morphology optional.
- [P. rhinanthoides (DE205)](/assets/flowers/DE205-rhinanthoides.jpg): Morphology always.

- 31°43'12.1" N, 100°42'53.9" E
- 31.7200277, 100.7149722
- Rocky meadow near stream.
- This site we did not collect enough specimens of cranolopha last time. I 
think it may be hard to find. If you have time, please try to find 
2-3 specimens for vouchers from this location. But if short on time,
then forget it.
- Take note, there is a side road after this stop, before the big loop,
which you should take to find site 118.

- P. cranolopha (DE206): Morphology and <b>2-3 voucher specimens.</b>
