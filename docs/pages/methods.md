### Specimen and silica leaf collection instructions:
- If you are visiting a previous collection site (most stops on the itinerary)
then record any collections using the existing site ID.
- If you are collecting at a new site then assign a new locality ID. 
For new sites, please start counting by naming your first locality 156, 
as this will provide a continuation from previous year’s collections.
- Assign an accession number (ID) to each species that you make a new 
specimen collection for at a new site. I suggest that you use Jianjun’s 
name for collection IDs, so call the first species JJ1, then JJ2, etc.
- If you are revisiting a previous site and collecting morphometrics for 
a species with an existing DE- accession number then label it according to
its existing DE accession label. 
- Collect pressed voucher specimens for any species for which a new 
collection is made <i>at a new site</i>. Vouchers do not need to be made 
when collecting at revisited sites (existing DE- IDs).
- When pressing voucher specimens collect 3 copies. One will be deposited to 
KIB and two will be sent by mail to USA. You can press several plants onto 
a single newspaper to fill the space when plants are small. In the field I 
label the newspaper with a sharpie marker to write the site location 
(e.g., site 156), and later in the hotel we pick several leaves from the 
specimen to make a silica collection, and at this point we assign an 
accession ID (e.g., JJ10), and write this on the newspaper specimen and on 
the leaf envelope, and in a notebook with the collection info. 
At least two leaves (or more depending on leaf size) should be collected 
from a single individual and placed into a paper envelope and sealed with 
a paper or staple. The envelope should be labeled with a collection number 
and species name if you know it (e.g., JJ10\n P. cranolopha). Put the envelope
in a large plastic ziploc bag full of silica gel. Record in a notebook the 
locality ID, accession number, species name, GPS coordinate, county, and 
location description (e.g., on Highway X near Kasha lake).
- Fill wooden plant press each night, place near space heater 
(not too close or the plants might burn). Check plants in morning for 
dryness. If dry, move labeled newspapers with plants to a plastic bag for 
finished specimens. 


### Genome plant collections (includes pollen and population sampling)
- Select a <i>large plant with abundant flowers</i> (for pollen) that also 
has fresh leaf tissues.
- A genome collection includes the following:
	- a voucher specimen (labeled according to the existing DE ID, unless at a new site)
	- frozen very young leaves for DNA
	- frozen very young leaves for RNA
	- frozen very young flower buds for RNA
	- frozen very young root tips for RNA
	- abundant pollen sample **from the same exact individual**
	- silica leaf collections for 10 additional individuals.
- If the plants are very small (e.g., latituba) then make sure the leaf DNA
and pollen comes from the same individual, but RNA annotation tissues can 
come from other individuals if needed.
- For long-read DNA collect large amounts of fresh young leaf tissues 
into liquid nitrogen. Place a label inside the tube with pen and marker 
written on paper with the accession number and tissue type. Screw the lid 
very very very tight. 
- Use separate tubes for leaves, flowers, and root tissues.
- Collect pollen from the same individual as the genome DNA by extracting 
anthers using clean tweezers and placing into eppendorf tubes. You should be 
able to see the pollen when shaking the anthers in the tube. We need as large
an amount as possible. Collect as much as you can from the existing flowers 
when you find the plant. Then remove open flowers, dig the plant and place 
in a pot, bring it with you for several days and then collect more pollen as 
new flowers open. Label this second collection differently. This is the best 
collection, the first open-flower collection will be used as a backup.
- Collect leaf tissues from 10 additional individuals into envelopes, 
label by the accession ID and a number (e.g., DE509-1, DE509-2, etc). 
These 10 samples will be used for population genetics. You do not need to
make additional voucher specimens for these 10 replicates.  


### Transcriptome comparative samples
- Make a voucher specimen and silica leaf collection
- Collect leaf and flower tissues into separate tubes with paper labels 
inside and put into liquid nitrogen (same as described above).
- Tissues should be very very young. Remove calyx from flower buds.


### Morphometrics:
- Collect whole plant or several inflorescences into large plastic bags for
performing 3d morphometric photogrametry later. 
- Remove calyx.
- Mount flowers in the photo box and take >100 photos following Jianjun's instructions.


### General collecting:
Many of the sites I will indicate a previous accession number (e.g., DE513) 
if we already have a specimen and silica sample for the species from that 
site. If so, then you do not need to make a new herbarium collection unless 
you are collecting something new. You can just sample the requested tissues, 
take photos, and collect morphometrics.

When you visit sites that are not previous collections then you should 
collect all Pedicularis species you can find (as much as you have time for). 
When visiting new sites (e.g., Xizang) make sure especially that you make 
collections of these widespread species of interest whenever you see 
them in new regions:   
- P. cranolopha or tricolor, 
- P. integrifolia
- P. lachnoglossa
- P. rhinanthoides
- P. kansuensis
- P. longiflora.
- P. delavayi or siphonantha-like.
