### Numpy and Pandas
The `numpy` and `pandas` libraries are the core of data science in Python.
The numpy `ndarray` and pandas `DataFrame` class objects are custom classes
that can be used to store, visualize, and operate on structured data. 
Here we will explore how you can use these custom classes within your own
code, once again thinking about going beyond scripting -- the type of 
exercises you have been doing with these data structures in notebooks -- 
and how to use them inside of a program.


### Recap
Last session you began a mini-project in a repo called `hack-program`. The
goal was to write a Python package containing a module with at least
one function in it that takes one or more arguments. You then made a 
`setup.py` script to make the package <i>installable</i>, and also created
an <i>entry point</i> to your function so it could be called as an 
executable program. 


### Challenge: Add data science to your mini-project
Your challenge today is to return to your program and to add additional 
features using either the numpy or pandas libraries, or both. Let's consider
the simple example of the darwinday program shared in class. This has two 
functions, one that computed the number of days until Darwin's birthday, and
another that returned a random string. How could numpy or pandas be added
to this package? Here are a few example ideas:

1. make a CSV file with hundreds of quotes in it, and load the file 
using pandas `.read_csv()`, then randomly sample quotes from it using 
pandas `.sample` function.

2. using numpy we could random sample a day (e.g., a number in 0-365) and
return the distance from that day to Darwin day. Or we could randomly sample
a date in time (any year) and report the age of Darwin.

3. You could find a CSV database of celebrity birthdates online 
(or create one) and randomly sample N birthdays and compile the pandas
DataFrame with their names and how much older or younger than Darwin they 
are, and return the result as a nicely formatted DataFrame.


### Let's focus on the last example, how might we go about this?
For me, I would start by creating a class to organize my plan. Let's do a 
psuedo-code exercise to plan what this would look like:


```python
# rough pseudo-code outline of our plan
class DarwinDates:
    def __init__(self):
        self.darwinday = '...'    # store datetime here
        self.data = '...'         # read CSV DataFrame here

    def random_sample(self, n):
        self.data = '...'         # subsample DataFrame to n rows here

    def calculate_age_comparision(self):
        # iterate over dataframe comparing each date
        for idx in self.data.index:

            # get birthday of a person
            pass

            # compare to darwin's 
            pass

            # store result as difference in number of day
            pass
```

OK, now that we have a plan let's fill this in with real code. I wrote the 
following bit by bit, testing each function as I wrote it. Read through this
code carefully. You can see that it defines three functions in addition to 
the `__init__()` function. The last one `.run()` is used to call the two 
functions in the middle. The example test that I run at the end shows that 
you can implement this code by simply init'ing the instance and calling .run.

```python
import datetime
import pandas as pd

# URL path to a CSV of famous birth dates
URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richard512/Little-Big-Data/master/famous-birthdates.csv"

class DarwinDates:
    def __init__(self):
        # store Darwin's birthday 
        self.darwinday = datetime.datetime(1859, 2, 12)

        # load the database of birthdates from a URL and split on " "
        self.data = pd.read_csv(URL, sep=" ")

    def random_sample(self, n):
        """
        Randomly sample n famous dates. Overwrite .data attribute w/ new 
        subsample. Also drop columns that are not relevant.
        """
        # drop any samples that have NaN for the date
        self.data = self.data[~self.data.birthDate.isna()]

        # random sample n rows, and set index back to starting from zero
        self.data = self.data.sample(n).reset_index(drop=True)

        # keep only these selected columns
        self.data = self.data.loc[:, ["firstname", "lastname", "birthDate"]]

    def calculate_age_comparison(self):
        """
        Counts age difference in days between each person and Darwin
        """
        # create new column to store age results and set to 0
        self.data["Darwin_age_days"] = 0

        # iterate over each row (index) in data
        for idx in self.data.index:

            # get birthdate string
            bday = self.data.at[idx, "birthDate"]

            # split string to get data
            year, month, day = bday.strip().split("-")

            # get as datetime object
            date = datetime.datetime(int(year), int(month), int(day))

            # get diff from darwin
            diff = self.darwinday - date

            # store result in unit of days
            self.data.loc[idx, "Darwin_age_days"] = diff.days

    def run(self, n):
        """
        Put it all together into a single function call that returns 
        a dataframe with your results
        """
        self.random_sample(n)
        self.calculate_age_comparision()
        return self.data
```
```python
# test the code (e.g., in a notebook or using 'build')
inst = DarwinDates()
inst.run(10)
```

OK, I tested this code and it works well. We now have a simple class we
can initialize an instance of, and then pass it a number for how many dates
to sample and get a dataframe result using the function call `.run()`. 
So, if we next want to create an executable script (entry point) to call 
this code we should plan to write a function similar to the test above.
The appropriate place to put this in our package is in `__main__.py`. Our
goal then might be to create an executable that could work like this:

```bash
darwindates --n 10
```
```bash
        firstname    lastname   birthDate  Darwin_age_days
0       Necmettin     Erbakan  1926-10-29           -24730
1            Hans   Tietmeyer  1931-08-18           -26484
2  Manuel Antonio     Noriega  1934-02-11           -27392
3            Suha      Arafat  1963-07-17           -38140
4         Andreas  Papandreou  1919-02-05           -21907
5          Carl C       Icahn  1936-02-16           -28127
6       Mikhail M    Kasyanov  1957-12-08           -36093

### Assignment
<div class="alert alert-success">
    Your assignment is to update your hack-program package to use numpy and/or
    pandas. The first time around we focused on getting the structure of the 
    package correct, in terms of imports, setup.py, etc. Now we are turning 
    our focus to the content of your package. Spend some time thinking up a
    creative way to use numpy or pandas in your functions. Your module can
    include multiple functions if needed. Try go expand beyond the simple
    datetime example I have shared, and to create something new. If you are 
    totally stuck feel free to visit the chatroom to crowdsource some ideas
    and get feedback on your code.
    <br><br>
    Commit and push updates to your repo before Monday. We will share the 
    programs in breakout rooms during class.
