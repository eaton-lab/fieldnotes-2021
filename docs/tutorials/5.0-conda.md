### What is conda?
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is an open-source software management 
tool for installing software packages, as well as their dependencies, and 
creating sandboxed environments for executing code. Using the `conda` command
line tool you can use simple commands to search for software packages, select 
specific versions, and install them locally on your machine. This automated
process makes installing and removing software simple and reproducible which makes
it easier to design, distribute and use working software.


### Why use conda?
The many advantages of using conda include:

- **command-line convenience**: the conda command line program allows you to 
search for and install tools with simple commands that can even be written
as scripts for automation. This makes it easy to replicate the set of software
tools installed on one computer onto another machine. 

- **finding dependencies**: Almost every software program builds on and requires
other software packages as dependencies. Rather than telling a user to go 
find and install each of these dependencies on their own (a sure sign of 
a poorly developed tool by today's standards) a software package manager
can instead fetch and install of the dependencies for them. This might even
include different dependencies or versions depending on their specific operating
system. This is a very complex task and something conda does very well.

- **sandboxed directory**: conda installs software into a *sandboxed* location 
on your computer (usually a directory within HOME), which is done purposefully
to keep your conda software completely separate and isolated from your 
system-wide software (which is usually in /bin or /usr/bin). 
This gives you peace of mind to install, update, and remove packages as much
as you want inside of your conda directory without having to worry that it 
might ever impact your system programs. 

- **environments**: In addition to allowing you to install software programs into
a sandboxed location, conda also allows you to keep many separate *environments*,
where you can keep different sets of software or versions of them. This makes it easy 
to test software tools across different version of dependencies, or to keep 
software separate that uses different conflicting dependencies. 


### Install conda (miniconda3)
There are two main flavors of conda that you can install: Anaconda and 
Miniconda. Both include a version of Python and the conda program 
(which is written in Python) as well as a few dependencies of conda for
fetching information about packages online. However, the two flavors differ
in terms of which *other* tools come pre-loaded with these base resources.
Anaconda comes fully loaded with dozens of commonly used Python packages, 
whereas Miniconda in totally minimal, and doesn't come with anything extra
at all. I always recommend installing Miniconda, and then adding to it any
software that you want to install. 

To install Miniconda you can google search 'Miniconda install' and it will
point you to the following [download page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
Here you will see many links for different versions of Miniconda. First, 
there is a version for different operating systems (Window, MacOSX, Linux). 
If you are on a Mac then select from the Mac section, if you are on Linux
or Windows Subsystem for Linux then select the Linux version. Do not install
the Windows version. Next you will that within each category there is an option
for Python 2.7 and 3.8 (or newer). Python 2.7 is the legacy version
of Python that was most popular for nearly a decade, and so tons of software in 
the world has been built on 2.7. However, Python3 is newer and better, and it
is time for the world to move on. So we will be using the Python3 version.
Under Linux it lists a 32-bit and 64-bit version, be sure to select the 64-bit version 
(32-bit is only for very old computers). Under Mac it lists `pkg` or `bash`
in the name, select the `bash` version. OK, now that you have found the version 
that you should install, click on the blue link and copy the URL address, since
we are going to use the command line to install conda.


```bash
# cd to your HOME directory
cd ~

# download the Miniconda installer from the URL using wget
# If you are on Linux this is the appropriate URL
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# If you are on a Mac this is the appropriate URL
# wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

# call bash to install conda from the .sh install script in 'batch' (auto) mode
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64 -b

# check that the miniconda3 folder now appears in HOME
ls -l ~
```

When you execute the `bash` command above it will start running the installer
script. By default, this will select `~/miniconda3` as the location to install
conda and its associated folders. That's good. 
It will then list the names of the packages it is installing, 
including Python3.8 and about 20 Python package dependencies. It 
should take a minute or less to finish.


### Adding `conda` to your PATH
At this point we have now created a new folder containing conda, but it is
not yet added to our PATH, meaning that we can't easily use this software
yet. Our goal here will be set the miniconda3/ directory at the front
of our PATH variable. This means that our shell will look here first for
any software, and only look in the other folders in the PATH for software
if it was not already found here. One specific reason this is useful is that
your shell will find this new version of Python (3.8) in Miniconda and use
it instead of some stodgy old system-wide version that is likely lurking 
deep in your computer somewhere. Before we proceed let's look at which 
version of Python is currently set as your default (i.e., at the front 
of you PATH). You can do this with tab-completion by starting to type 
python and then pressing tab. You should see that there is a binary 
somewhere called python3 or python2.7, etc. You can also see all versions
in their PATH order by using `whereis` like below.

```bash
# IF one is in your path this will show it.
which python

# this will show all versions of Python on your system
whereis python
```

Let's now add conda to your PATH by editing the dotfile (e.g., .bashrc)
in your HOME directory. While we could do this by hand, conda has 
developed a convenient script that can do it for us, and do it in kind
of a fancy way. So let's use this tool called `conda init`. To use it
we will need to provide the full path to the binary file since it is
not yet in our PATH. Run the command below and you should see an example
output similar to below.

```bash
~/miniconda3/condabin/conda init $SHELL
```
<pre style="background-color: darkgrey; padding:10px">no change     /home/deren/miniconda3/condabin/conda
no change     /home/deren/miniconda3/bin/conda
no change     /home/deren/miniconda3/bin/conda-env
no change     /home/deren/miniconda3/bin/activate
no change     /home/deren/miniconda3/bin/deactivate
no change     /home/deren/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
no change     /home/deren/miniconda3/etc/fish/conf.d/conda.fish
no change     /home/deren/miniconda3/shell/condabin/Conda.psm1
no change     /home/deren/miniconda3/shell/condabin/conda-hook.ps1
no change     /home/deren/miniconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/xontrib/conda.xsh
no change     /home/deren/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.csh
modified     /home/deren/.bashrc

==> For changes to take effect, close and re-open your current shell <==
</pre>

You can see that this edited the dotfile in my home directory. Remember, 
this is the file that is run every time you open a terminal which loads
a bunch of variables including the PATH where software is found and 
to set the style and colors of the prompt. When you run `conda init $SHELL`
it writes a new block at the end of the dotfile for your specific shell
 telling it to make your terminal aware of conda whenever it starts up. 
 If you wanted to stop it from doing this you would only need to remove that block of text 
from the dotfile. The code in this block does two things: 
(1) it tells your prompt to show the name of the conda environment; 
and (2) it adds the filepath of your miniconda3 directory to the front
of your PATH variable so that you can find all of the 
tools there. For this to go into effect close and reopen your terminal.

You can now test whether the `conda` command line tool is in your PATH
by typing the following command, which will print info about your conda
directory.

```bash
conda info
```
<pre style="background-color: darkgrey;padding:10px">     active environment : base
    active env location : /home/deren/miniconda3
            shell level : 1

             netrc file : None
           offline mode : False
</pre>

Let's also look again for where Python is installed on our system. We should
see a version of Python located in our miniconda3 directory at the front of 
the PATH:

```bash
# this should show the miniconda Python path
which python
```
<pre style="background-color: darkgrey;padding:10px">/home/deren/miniconda3/bin/python
</pre>

<div class="alert alert-info">
	Take note of this result. This is the path to the version of Python 
	that we will be using extensively throughout this course. It is located
	inside of your miniconda3/ directory, and then inside of a directory called
	bin/. This latter subdirectory is where all binaries (executable callable
	programs) installed by conda will be located.
</div>


### Using conda
The command line tool is called `conda`. This is a binary 
(executable program) written in Python and installed in your
miniconda directory. Because this directory is in your PATH the 
`conda` binary is also in your PATH. This is why you can call it 
from your terminal without needing to write the full path to the 
location of the binary. Let's try installing some other binaries
using conda. The syntax for installing a program with conda is
`conda {program_name} -c {channel_name}`. Try the example below:

```bash
conda install cowpy -c conda-forge
```

This installed a goofy Python program called cowsay that can be
used to make funny ASCII drawings in your terminal. Under the hood
it installed a Python package, and also a binary command line tool
that ships with this Python library. The Python library is installed
into `miniconda3/pkgs/` and the binary is installed into `miniconda3/bin/`
Let's try out the cowpy binary by writing some text in the terminal 
with `echo` and piping it to the `cowpy` program. For more details on the
cowpy program you can [find it on GitHub](https://github.com/jeffbuttars/cowpy)

```bash
echo "hello world" | cowpy
```

### Conda channels
Different software packages are found on different channels on conda. 
Channels are just big online folders where conda recipes are stored. 
Most software is available on one of three channels:
"default", "conda-forge", and "bioconda". You can find out which channel
a software package is available on by googling `conda {software_name}`. 
The bioconda channel includes many bioinformatics specific tools. The
conda-forge channel contains the cutting-edge versions of almost all 
software, and is very actively community maintained. The default channel
is maintained by the anaconda organization, and tends to be a little out
of date, and has the least software. After years of using conda 
I strongly recommnd setting the conda-forge channel as your default 
channel. This means that it will always look here first for a requested
package or any of its dependencies, and only look at other channels after
first looking here. This is a good thing.

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Here we are setting a configuration preference. So how do you think that 
was done? That's right, it wrote it to a dotfile. In this case it simply
added the preferred conda channel order to a file called `~/.condarc`. 
Let's test this out by installing another package. Now we no longer 
need to tell it `-c conda-forge` since it will look there by default.
(Personally, I still usually write it anyways just out of habit, so 
you may see it in future instructions).

```bash
# install the Python 'requests' packages
conda install requests
```

### Conda environments
In this class we will work only using your 'base' conda environment. 
Usually you will not need to use additional environments until you become
a power user. You can read more about environments in the conda docs.


### The purposeful impermanence of conda
In Tibetan Buddhism there is a tradition involving the creation of 
large complex mosaic [*mandalas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_mandala)
carefully constructed from colored sand, often involving many weeks of work. 
Upon completion of the artwork it is then destroyed. This meditative exercise 
is intended to make one reflect on the impermanence of life, and to experience
the act of letting go.

The sand mandala tradition has a lot to teach us about our relationships
with our conda software directory. You may feel that after working with 
conda for several weeks that you have installed the perfect set of software
tools that includes everything you will ever need. And you become very 
attached to it. But, you should feel free to let it go. 

Software becomes outdated quickly, and updating many many software packages to new
versions can sometimes conflict with other programs in your environment to cause problems.
Usually conda can fix these problems and find the right versions that work
together. But in some cases it can't. It simply worked itself into a corner
where it basically needs to uninstall and reinstall everything again. This is
the point when you should consider destroying it.

That is to say, you can easily remove your conda directory, and reinstall it.
Remember we just installed it above, it takes a single command, it's very fast.
To remove the conda directory you can use the `rm` command along with the options
`-r` and `-f`. The `-r` option tells it that the thing we want to remove is a 
folder. The `-f` command means 'force'. This is a slightly dangerous command 
if you were to tell it to delete something that you shouldn't. So take care that
the file path after this command is the one that you actually want to remove
and not something else (like your entire filesystem). 

```bash
# this command would remove your conda directory completely
# rm -rf ~/miniconda3
```

### Assessment
None. You will need to have successfully installed conda to complete the next tutorial.
