<h2 id="exploring-ee-data">Exploring ee data</h2>

<h3 id="datasets">Datasets</h3>
<p>Datasets can be a vector 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FeatureCollection</code>, an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Image</code> or an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImageCollection</code>. The first is GeoJson,
while the latter two are rasters, which we’ll focus on here.</p>

<p>An <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Image</code> represents a single image in which values are assigned to grid 
cells on a map. It can contain multiple <em>bands</em> (layers) that describe 
different measurements represented on the same image. For example, an Image
could contain a temperature band with float values between -300 and 300
representing degrees Celsius, and it could also contain a band with boolean 
values showing forest cover and present or absent. You should read the<br />
description of the Image in the data catalog to learn what bands it contains,
their dtype, and the range of values represented. An Image could include any
arbitrary collection of bands. You could even create your own Image and upload
it for others to use.</p>

<p>An <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImageCollection</code> represents multiple Images taken at different time periods,
and which share the same metadata properties, meaning they will be the same size
and contains the same bands of data. ImageCollections are used to compute or
visualize how measurements change over time.</p>

<h3 id="bioclim-dataset-v1">BioClim dataset V1</h3>
<p>Let’s load and investigate a raster Image dataset. This one is called
the WORLDCLIM or BIOCLIM dataset, and is widely used for modeling species 
distributions in ecology since it includes a bunch of biologically relevant 
temperature and precipitation variables. The link below provides information 
on the <em>bands</em>, including their dtype (e.g., int, float) and the range of 
values present (e.g., 0 to 100, or -10000 to 10000). 
<a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WORLDCLIM_V1_BIO#bands">https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WORLDCLIM_V1_BIO#bands</a>.</p>

<p>The bottom of the data catalog page includes a set of instructions for making
one simple visualization of the dataset, so let’s start with that, and 
try to understand exactly what is happening when we draw this image. As you

<p>To draw the map in this example we used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.select</code> function of the Image
to choose just one <em>band</em> to show. The ‘bio01’ band contains values in the 
range -230 to 300, and so in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add_ee_raster</code> function we tell it a set
of arguments for how to transform the existing values into a range of colors
to be shown as a bitmap. This says to make values at -230 blue, and values
at 300 red, with intermediate values scaled in a range by the set of colors 
listed in between.</p>

<p>This is just one way to select this band, and to choose how to draw it. We could
similarly select the band as a vis param, and we could provide a different palette
to describe how to show the values. Here’s an example in black and white.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img class="pngmap" src="./images/folium-ee-1.png" /></p>

<p>Similarly, we could add additional bands to the map as separate raster layers.
Here I add a second bioclim variable as a raster, and set its visual params
to match to its range of values as well. When showing multiple bands we 
could change their opacity so that both are visible at the same time, or we 
could have each show a different color and combine them, or we could turn on
LayerControl, as I did in this case so that the user can toggle which to show.</p>

<h3 id="mapping-bands-to-colors">Mapping bands to colors</h3>
<p>A common usage of <em>bands</em> in images is to create composite images where different
colors are mapped to different bands of the image. In fact, the default behavior
of raster images when you pass multiple bands is to treat the bands as red, blue, 
and green layers, where the values represent magnitudes of each color. Under
the hood, this is what happens when you draw a raster, it takes the vis_params
that you provide and converts the data values into three bands representing 
red, blue and green to make a colored image. Even if your vis_params say to 
plot the image in black and white, it represents greyish values by a combination
of rbg values over three bands. This can be seen by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.visualize()</code>
function of an Image, which is used under the hood when plotting a raster.
This is the function that converts images to rbg, and it can be useful to 
learn for operations like making new images.</p>

<p>Let’s first look at the bands that are in our image.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># returns a dict showing that there are 19 bands of dtype float
</span><span class="n">bioclim</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">bandTypes</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">getInfo</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here I create a new Image by mapping the values from the bio01 band in the 
range -300 to 300 as white to black. The returned Image will contain three
bands with the visualized data as a rbg image.
You can see there are now three bands in the range 0-255. This dtype (bytes)
is the default in ee for representing colored images.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># get new Image of bio01 visualized with these vis-params
</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">bioclim</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">visualize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bands</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"bio01"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">min</span><span class="o">=-</span><span class="mi">300</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">max</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">300</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">palette</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'white'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'black'</span><span class="p">])</span>

 'vis-red': {'type': 'PixelType', 'precision': 'int', 'min': 0, 'max': 255}}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="creating-modified-image-objects">Creating modified Image objects</h3>
<p>Let’s imagine we wanted to show two bands of the BioClim dataset, but we want
to generate a very specific way of combining the variables into an image. Let’s
say I wanted to show the mean-temp as a black and white layer, and over
that I want precipitation to appear as tan to blue. So cold and dry regions 
will be dark and tan, and warm wet areas will be light and blue. 
It will be faster
to visualize this dataset if we combine it into one raster image rather than 
plotting two separate layers with an opacity overlay. We can combine the two
bands using Image computations. In this case I use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.add()</code> to add their values
together on the three colored layers. The new image is then in the range of 
integer values 0-510. We could either visualize this image by setting vis_param
settings to range over that domain, or as I do here, convert the image back to
the range 0-255.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>There is so much you can do with Image and ImageCollection data. I encourage
you to explore any tutorials you can find online, especially in the ee 
documentation for further examples. There you will find many more operations
than were shown here, including masking, clustering, converting raster to 
vectors, or vectors to rasters, machine learning, time-series analysis, 
and many more visualization tricks.</p>

<b>Assignment:</b>
Your assignment is to complete the ee tutorial for visualizing global forest
change as described here in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_forest_02?hl=en">Hansen dataset tutorial</a>. 

<br /><br />
This tutorial will probably take
about 60 minutes to complete. The main challenge is in figuring out how to 
translate the JS into Python code. Revisit the ee docs on [translating between
JS and Python](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install#syntax).
And use your knowledge of what valid Python code should look like.

<br /><br />
You should complete the tutorial in a jupyter notebook. 
To visualize the maps with `folium` be sure to copy and 
paste in the definition of our EarthEngine class definition (from the last
tutorial) for adding ee layers to a folium Map.

<br /><br />
When you finish the tutorial you should have produced a map like the one in the
end of the tutorial. When you add the raster to your EngineMap be sure to 
include the argument `attr=yourname` to it. This will make your name show up 
in the lower-right corner attribution of the raster layer, confirming that you 
created the map. For example:

<pre><code>
emap = EngineMap()
emap.add_ee_raster(image, vis_params={...}, attr="Deren")
</code></pre>


To submit your assignment create a new repo called folium-ee and add to it 
two things: your notebook and a screencapture PNG of your final map. You can
also include a README if you'd like. 
<b>The assignment is due on 4/19 at 1pm EST. You should commit change to your 
repo before this deadline.</b>

If you get stuck I recommend first revisiting sections of the ee documentation,
and then reaching out to the chatroom.

After storing the Image object as a variable, ...
a reference to this dataset I show
below that when we call print on this object it does not tell us very much 
information. This is because we do not actually have the dataset stored as a
variable, we only have a *reference* to it. This is the deferred execution 
framework in action. In the Python API the way to actually tell the code to
*execute* (make a request to the REST API) is to use the object function call 
`.getInfo()`. Nearly every object will have this function as an option. You 
can see in this example that when we call this it return a representation of the
Image object, which is represented by some metadata information.

```
# Print image object WITHOUT call to getInfo(); prints serialized request instructions.
print(bioclim)
```

It is simply the set of JSON instructions for loading the data set.
```
ee.Image({
  "functionInvocationValue": {
    "functionName": "Image.load",
    "arguments": {
      "id": {
        "constantValue": "WORLDCLIM/V1/BIO"
      }
    }
  }
})
```

This will show the meta information about which layers are in the image, their
projections, their data types, and other descriptions. It is a bit too long
and hard to read, so I will not print it here.

```python
# Print image object WITH call to getInfo(); prints image metadata.
print(bioclim.getInfo())
```

Instead, let's examine the most relevant info for an image which is the `bands`,
i.e., the distinct layers of grid cells that have values assigned to them. A 
normal colored image can be represented by three bands: red, green, and blue, 
(rgb), and many Image objects will be represented in this way, with integer
values assigned to each cell on each layer with a value between 0-255.

```
bioclim_image.bandTypes().getInfo()
```

### Get information about a raster

```python
# 
img.bandTypes().getInfo()
```

```

```

### get a data baselayer and show in folium

Now we can create an `EngineMap` instance just like we would a normal `Map`
class instance. This object has all of the functions and attributes of a 
`folium.Map` in addition to the two functions we added to it above, which
allow adding raster or vectors from the `ee` package. 

```python
emap = EngineMap(location=[40, -75], zoom_start=6)
emap.add_ee_raster()
```


### EE Javascript Library

[EE Javascript Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorials)
Being google they have pretty good tutorials, including a bunch of youtube
videos, which can be a great resource for learning. The EE library is object
oriented and includes a large suite of `ee` class objects that act as 
containers around base JavaScript types, such as strings, lists, or arrays. 

You can sign up for and use the online google earth engine code editor directly
in your browser [https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_api_01]
(https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_api_01), which 
is a great way to learn interactively about the object types and what 
functions and operations are available.


Here we will about the `ee` [Python library](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install#syntax), which further acts as a wrapper
to create JSON strings that represent the content of these JavaScript `ee`
type objects. It's a bit complicated and abstract, and it is likely
easier to become a pro at Earth Engine by learning JavaScript, but for 
most relatively simple actions the Python wrapper will be easier to use, 
since you are likely to be more familiar with the syntax.


### Deferred Execution
You will find that many steps in writing `ee` code seem like they don't really
do anything. There are many steps that together help to build a *request* for
what type of data and functions to run when computation is actually started,
but `ee` is designed to defer the execution of any of that work until it is 
all ready, at which time it a `start()` call is made to run it. This design
is based on the fact that a lot of `ee` execution is done in the cloud, where
this workflow is more efficient.

An example is the execution of `ee.batch()` functions, which are used to 
export data from google to a google drive folder
(storage is not unlimited/free).

```python
# define an export task object
task = ee.batch.Export.image.toDrive(
    image=my_image,                      # an ee.Image object.
    region=my_geometry,                  # an ee.Geometry object.
    description='mock_export',
    folder='gdrive_folder',
    fileNamePrefix='mock_export',
    scale=1000,
    crs='EPSG:4326',
)

# start the export (runs asynchronously -- you can continue to execute code)
task.start()

# check on progress of task
task.status()
```


### Saving `Images`

Saving Images and saving PNGs.

If you look around the internet for examples of `folium` and `ee` being used
together you can find some nice example tutorials, but you'll probably find
that their maps in the tutorials often don't actually work (i.e., the raster
layers don't show up). What's the deal? 

Well, the rasters did show up when they ran the code, and they would show up
for you if you rerun their code, but it will not show up for you as an 
after-the-fact observer looking at the leaflet map hosted somewhere on the web.
**This is because the querying the tileset is not free.** 
Each time you load a view at a particular zoom level Google is doing work, 
and they don't want to do any more work for free than necessary. 
This is what the `ee.Initialize()` step is doing in your code. It is 
sending your info so that Google knows when a request is made who's quota
to assign the work to. 

code that they wrote includes proper instructions for 

### What is an Image

It is a set of one or more image files (tiles) that have the same area,
resolution, and number of bands (layers). In other words, they have the same
bitmap array dimensions. The input data for a tileset is always provided at 
its highest resolution (e.g., 10m cells). Google will then take these 
images and apply a method called *pyramiding* to generate a value for each
cell at each step of its zoomed-out resolutions. By default it will apply the
mode to categorical, or mean to continutous, values of the cells to its 
zoomed-out parent cell, but these functions can be modified. 


### Asset management
See the [asset management](...) section of the earthengine docs for details
on how to save raster data to make them publicly available. Using these 
resources will count against your quota, but unless you are expecting 
thousands of requests per day you will likely not exceed it. Your asset
images will be available in **users/username**. These would then be
accessible with:

```python
image = ee.Image('users/yourfolder/yourimage');
```

You can likely get expanded space/quota to store and share images 
through your University account, if needed. I haven't looked into this yet.
You can set 'sharing' settings on your Images so that only certain users
or organizations (Google accounts) can access them. This will prevent random
users from accessing it and using up your quota. 

### Analysis result Images
See more details under asset management. 
When you perform on analysis on existing Images to create a new Image that 
you want to save as a result, you will want to export this file as either a
GeoTIFF formatted file (bitmap image) or as a TFRecord file, if your analysis
was a machine-learning model prediction.
