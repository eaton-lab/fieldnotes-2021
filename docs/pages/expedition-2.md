## Day 2: Shimian to Xinduqiao

- Revisit sites from previous years to collect morphometric
  data for species that we already have collections for 
  (DE- accession numbers)

- Collect <i>P. davidii</i> genome plant, pollen, RNAs for annotation,
  and silica leaf collections for 10 individuals for popgen.

- Collect RNA for comparative transcriptomes for brevilabris, delavayi, 
dolichoglossa, and siphonantha.
