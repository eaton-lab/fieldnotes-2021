## Day 2: Shangri-la to Markam

Start by visiting the Shangri-la Gaoshan Botanic Garden to collect the 
genome plant of P. tricolor, and the transcriptome plant of P. dichotoma. 
It is also possible to visit here at the very end of the trip instead.
But these samples are very important.


- Estimated driving times: 
	- Shangri-la to Deqen: 3 hours
	- Deqen to Markam: 4.25 hours
