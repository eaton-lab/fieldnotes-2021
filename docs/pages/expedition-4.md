## Day 4: Litang to Litang (day trips)

- Day trips around Litang.

- Revisit sites from previous years to collect morphometric
  data for species that we already have collections for 
  (DE- accession numbers)

- Collect <i>P. latituba</i> genome plant, pollen, RNAs for annotation,
  and silica leaf collections for 10 individuals for popgen.

- Collect RNA for comparative transcriptomes for ...

- 4301m
- Litang County. On old road above new tunnel near Litang on 
road towards Yajiang. Alpine meadow on N facing slope.

- lachnoglossa
- rhinanthoides
- integrifolia
- inaequilobata
- roylei

<h3 class="mt-5"> Site 19 </h3>
- 30°02'02.5" N,	100°22'29.9" E
- 4020m
- Litang County. Near junction of S217 and G318 just outside of Litang 
at intersection of two valleys and a river.	P. cranolopha admixture zone.

- cranolopha var. longicornuta (DE85)  
This admixture zone contains individuals with small, medium and large 
forked beaks. Try to collect morphometric images for all 3 types. 
Maybe label these as DE85-small, DE85-medium, DE85-large.
