<h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
<p>In class you will meet with other students that are members of your same 
<i>group</i> (A-D), and outside of class you will fork and clone the
repo of your paired-programming companion working on the same topic (
see table below). Try to run the minimal working example of their code.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-their-code">Exploring their code</h3>
<p>Your goal is to gain a better understanding of their code. You have been paired
together because your project goals share some similarities. If you see a place
in their code that is poorly formatted (e.g., your linter has highlighted it), 
then fix it. Commit the change and in the comment field state why you 
re-formatted it. If you are unsure why a certain part of code exists then 
stick a print or logger statement inside of the code block to print the state
of variables before and after that section of code runs. If you are still 
unsure then write a chat to your partner to ask about it.</p>

<p>Your goal is to make a commit to their project, and specifically, to identify
a place in their code where your commit can be useful. This means going beyond
the goal of our first paired-programming exercise where you could commit 
anything. Weâ€™re looking for more than just a comment line here. Need help? 
Just ask in the chatroom.</p>
