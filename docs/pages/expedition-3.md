## Day 3: Xinduqiao to Litang

- Revisit sites from previous years to collect morphometric
  data for species that we already have collections for 
  (DE- accession numbers)

- Collect RNA for comparative transcriptomes for ...

- Collect morphometric data for important cranolopha populations near Yajiang.

- <b>If the "old road" is not accessible</b> from one side, try the other side
as well. If neither is accessible then see the itinerary for day 5 which 
includes additional sites between Xinduqiao and Litang.
