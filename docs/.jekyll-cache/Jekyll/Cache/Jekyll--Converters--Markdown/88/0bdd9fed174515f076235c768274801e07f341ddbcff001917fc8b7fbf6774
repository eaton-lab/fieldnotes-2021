I"Ì<h3 id="final-project-submission">Final Project Submission</h3>

<p>Your final project submission is due on <strong>4/21/2022</strong> at 1pm EST. We will
begin grading projects based on commits made by this time, but you are of 
course welcome to continue working on your projects for as long as you would
like after class.</p>

<p>The final project is worth 20% of your total grade. Projects will
be graded on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Commit history/effort (40%)</li>
  <li>Python Code (15%)</li>
  <li>Minimal working example (15%)</li>
  <li>GitHub repository organization (10%)</li>
  <li>README.md install and demo instructions or other docs (10%)</li>
  <li>Paired programming commits or comments (10%)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="commit-history">Commit history</h3>
<p>By the project submission date you will have worked on your project for over
six weeks. Kind of amazing. Over this time youâ€™ve probably changed the code
dramatically, and hopefully developed something that is approaching your 
proposed goal. The git commits that you made along the way provide a 
record and timestamp of your progress. We will review your commit history
to get a snapshot of your contributions. Itâ€™s OK if you committed very little
one week, and much more another week.</p>

<h3 id="python-code">Python code</h3>
<p>We spent a fair bit of time in class discussing the proper way to organize
Python code. This involves following conventions that make it easier for 
others to read your code and understand what it is doing. You should place
imports at the top of modules, and use proper indentation, and try to split
your code among multiple separate modules if it becomes too long and 
complicated. These conventions can take a while to learn, and that is why
I repeatedly, relentlessly, tried to get everyone to implement a working 
linter in your code editor to provide hints about how to improve the style
of your code. We will examine your code organization to see that you have 
followed good coding styles. This doesnâ€™t mean you need to have fixed or 
accepted every single warning from your linter, but it will be very apparent
if you have ignored all of them.</p>

<h3 id="minimal-working-example">Minimal working example</h3>
<p>I should be able to install and run a minimal working example of your code
as described in your README file. As discussed previously, this does not 
mean that your program needs to be able to completely accomplish your proposed
goal at the time of submission. But it does need to be able to do something 
that shows it is on the way towards its goal.</p>

<h3 id="github-repo-organization">GitHub repo organization</h3>
<p>I will examine your GitHub repo to check that you have organized files into 
folders, that it looks well maintained and updated, and that you have 
removed any files that are not meant to be synced, like .egg folders, 
or .DStore files (files that are not part of your code or demos).</p>

<h3 id="readme-instructions-andor-documentation">README instructions and/or documentation</h3>
<p>Your README file should contain the name of your program, and short 
description, and instructions for how to install and run the minimal working
example. It should be nicely formatted using Markdown. Spend some time making
the formatting look nice. This should be a freebie, since you were required
to make most of this during your proposal.</p>

<h3 id="paired-programming-commits-or-comments">Paired programming commits or comments</h3>
<p>I will look for commits and comments youâ€™ve made to other students code. 
For your first paired-programming exercises I asked for you to try to contribute to 
other projects even if you do not have a ton to contribute. But I didnâ€™t 
make this a requirement for later paired-programming meetings, so it is OK
if you only discussed the projects in your in person meetings. If you have 
not made any commits to anyone elses repo then you should do so before the 
project submission date. This is essentially a form of participation points.</p>
